# PPI

A tool for feature calculation, PPI interaction prediction and docking score prediction, based on a heuristic multi-objective Pareto-based evolutionary optimization algorithm.

<h2> Tutorial </h2>

<p>A detailed description on how to run the proposed method for the PPI predictor and the affinity prediction can be found on the 'Tutorial' folder. The datasets used for the feature calculation are contained in the 'Datasets' folder. Examples of generated datasets and datasets used for commands are found in 'example_datasets' folder.</p>

<h2>Flowchart</h2>

<p>Here is the flowchart of the proposed method:</p>
